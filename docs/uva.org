  Early stop seems necessary, i.e.,

  #+BEGIN_SRC cpp
if (nerr >= 7 || ncor == ntot) break;
  #+END_SRC

  ~nerr~ is the number of wrong guesses, ~ncor~ the number of correct
  guesses.  There might be cases where you could both win and lose if
  you scan the whole guess string.

  The number during computation might be larger than ~int32~, use
  ~long long~ instead.
